==================

This HTML page and javascript draw an `svg` picture of the moon that tries to match the current 
actual phase of the moon.  Also uses unicode emoji moons in the `<title>` element.  A new `svg` will
be calculated every day; but there are only 8 emoji moons.

Phase of the moon

"A little while ago the task of calculating lunar phases came to mind. After investigating the various algorithms out there, I collected together this little bunch, (mainly wrapped inside complete 'show all the phases for a year' programs), and hacked them about a bit to work nicely with Javascript . They are presented here for your edification, delight and ripping off."

This javascript was modified into a function that returns a number between 0 and 1 representing how 
far through the lunar cycle we are.  0 and 1 are both new moons, 0.5 is the full moon.

SVG

uses the `A` command in `<path>` http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands

```xml

      <svg id="moon" viewBox="0 0 200 200">
            <!-- black background of moon is path class="moonback" -->

               this cycles between 0 and 20 -+                       |                  |
